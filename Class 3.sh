Two key take aways from today's class are

a) first several commands in BASH, such as "echo" and variables.
bï¼‰I have done a bit of python before and what we have done today is quite different from python.
It was my first time learning differences between a scripting language and a tool (like python)
that was built for general-purpose programming. I realized that there are many limitations in BASH,
however, it is really easy to write for repetitive, tedious tasks.
