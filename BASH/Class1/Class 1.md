Reflection for the first CS class
===================================

I've never expected computer science class to be as engaging and fun as we had on Wednesday!
(especially when I am writing this at the end of my first week and looking back to how tedious the first class of each subject can be.)
Two key takeaways I learned from the class were 1) How computational thinking is reflected in Math, Science, and many other different 
subjects. For instance, from the caculating the sum of 1 to 200 activity, I realized how a single math formula could be interpreted in
computational language.

Another key takeaway is from the ROT 13 activity. While me and my partner Tom had no idea what how to solve the task, we spotted on the 
'ROT 13' sign on the corner and googled the rule, accordingly found the meaning of the text. While we easily found the Happy.jpg from the
library computer, we struggled (as a class) in solving the myth. In the end, it turned out that we were taking the task too complicated 
while the only thing we had to do is actually "by hand, say we are initiated", which made me realize that the essence of computational 
thinking is essencially simple, but the product itself is complicated. Therefore as beginners we need to figure out what which step is 
about and make it very clear to ourselves then to create things that are bigger and more complicated. 

In short, I had so much fun in CS so far! However, I do recognize that I have little foundation in computer science that the only 
computational language I know is a bit of python. Therefore, I really need to wisely use my time and catch up with other aspects in
this subject:)
