Two key takeaways from today's class:

a) Today we spent most of our time working on the game. It was, to be honest, a lot of
frustration, because while using a lot of "if...then" commands, a lot of time it just does
not work well. Then I tried to use case command which made it much more easier.

b) Another takeaway is that we learnt how to update our local documents to the cloud,
which was super useful.
