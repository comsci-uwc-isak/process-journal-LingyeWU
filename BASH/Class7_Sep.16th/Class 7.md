Key takeaways from today's class
=================================

1. for loops. We've learnt the 4 different usage of for loop which is really interesting.
2. We learnt how to manipulate the arguments by putting numbers after the file name. This is pretty cool!
3. The HMW from the weekend gave me SO MUCH frustration that I spent more than 5 hours on it:( But it is worth it.
