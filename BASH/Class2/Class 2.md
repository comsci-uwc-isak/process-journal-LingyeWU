Class 2 Journal
================
Today we had a pretty packed class. I was new to pretty much everything but I learnt so much as well.
Several key takeaways from today's class are:

1. I was finally introduced to where "terminals" actually originated from and that was enligghtening!

2. The basic commands of DASH was lot of fun. Also dealing with unexpected situations such as "permission denied" with Arata was also fun.
(we figured out that at the end it was his virus-killing software that blocked us). The powerfulness of terminal, or dash language, is
tremendous and inspiring. 
3. We also learnt how to download files from github and a bit of reading on "creating new system".
In short, ComSci is just as fun. After a whole year's pretending-to-be-learning-something-but-actually-not, I am finally back on the right track!
